# Research Question1: 

# Metrics: Population of each area, closeness centrality of each area in the network, find underserved score = population/closeness centrality, highlighting areas with high population but low accessibility.

# Analysis: Identify areas with high underserved scores as priority zones. These are the areas where adding backup stations would likely have the most impact. Plot a graph to visualize results.
