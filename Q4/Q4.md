## Note: Keeping brief as a more extensive answer will be given for final submission

As is seen on the graph, the system is quite resilient, able to have over 500 of the most central nodes removed without
any significant issues past some obvious decline. When computing drop indices of at least 1%, we can see that at 537 station failures and 1423 station failures are when the first two significant drops occur. As is seen with the graph's components rising after roughly 1700, the failures past then are already far too critical to consider. That being said, these two failure points are computed with removing only the maximally critical nodes one at a time. Even in this case, 537 stations would need to fail before a distinct decline in connectedness happens, displaying that the charging network is especially resilient.
